Shiller and Campbell calculated the CAPE ratio by dividing a long-term broad-based index of stock market prices and earnings from 1871 by the average of the last 10 years of earnings per share, with earnings and stock prices measured in real terms. They regressed 10-year real stock returns against the CAPE ratio and found that the CAPE ratio is a significant variable that can predict long-run stock returns. The predictability of real stock returns implies that long-term equity returns are mean reverting. In other words, if the CAPE ratio is above (below) its long-run average, the model predicts belowaverage (above-average) real stock returns for the next 10 years. \n","\n","*Jeremy J.
